The code in this lab is meant to be run on a PIC12F508, but in lieu of purchasing hardware, we used the simulator provided by microcontrollerjs.com. If anyone wishes to test the BnB program, they can copy and paste the code into the simulator, extract it, and run it. To set up the GPIO in the simulator, you can click each of the pins to cycle between input (switch), output (LED), and neither. For this program, set GP0,1,2,5 to outputs and GP3,4 to inputs.
